  "abstract": "Observational Study of Hydroxychloroquine in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19 .\nBACKGROUND : Hydroxychloroquine has been widely administered to patients with Covid-19 without robust evidence supporting its use .\nMETHODS : We examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death at a large medical center in New York City .\nData were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with Covid-19 , excluding those who were intubated , died , or discharged within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department ( study baseline ) .\nThe primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis .\nWe compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those in patients who did not , using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score .\nRESULTS : Of 1446 consecutive patients , 70 patients were intubated , died , or discharged within 24 hours after presentation and were excluded from the analysis .\nOf the remaining 1376 patients , during a median follow-up of 22.5 days , 811 ( 58.9 % ) received hydroxychloroquine ( 600 mg twice on day 1 , then 400 mg daily for a median of 5 days ) ; 45.8 % of the patients were treated within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department , and 85.9 % within 48 hours .\nHydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine ( median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen , 223 vs. 360 ) .\nOverall , 346 patients ( 25.1 % ) had a primary end-point event ( 180 patients were intubated , of whom 66 subsequently died , and 166 died without intubation ) .\nIn the main analysis , there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death ( hazard ratio , 1.04 , 95 % confidence interval , 0.82 to 1.32 ) .\nResults were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses .\nCONCLUSIONS : In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital , hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death .\nRandomized , controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19 are needed .\n",
